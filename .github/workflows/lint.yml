# ABOUTME: Linting workflow for makeatron - runs golangci-lint on push/PR.
# ABOUTME: Uses golangci-lint-action with config from .golangci.yml.

# Cache strategy:
#   - Go modules (GOMODCACHE): Cached by actions/setup-go via `cache: true`.
#   - Go build cache (GOCACHE): Cached by actions/setup-go via `cache: true`.
#   - golangci-lint cache: Managed by golangci-lint-action. Stores analysis results
#     in ~/.cache/golangci-lint, keyed on .golangci.yml + go.sum. Avoids re-analyzing
#     unchanged packages on subsequent runs.
