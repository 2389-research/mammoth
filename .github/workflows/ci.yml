# ABOUTME: Main CI workflow for mammoth - runs vet, build, tests, and coverage on push/PR.
# ABOUTME: Uses Go module/build caching and uploads test results, coverage, and binary as artifacts.

# Cache strategy:
#   - Go modules (GOMODCACHE): Cached by actions/setup-go via `cache: true`.
#     Keyed on go.sum, shared across jobs. Avoids re-downloading deps on every run.
#   - Go build cache (GOCACHE): Cached by actions/setup-go via `cache: true`.
#     Stores compiled packages, speeds up incremental builds and test runs.
#   - golangci-lint cache: Handled separately in lint.yml by golangci-lint-action.
